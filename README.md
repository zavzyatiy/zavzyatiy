  Hi there, I'm Roman! ðŸ‘‹
</h2>

I am a Russian student at Moscow State University studying economics with a particular interest in programming. Currently, my academic pursuits focus on:

- theoretical foundations of antimonopoly regulations
- time-series econometrics within the fields of finance and cryptocurrencies

This page contains my ongoing and finished projects, which are mostly related to academic or research stuff in these fields.

If you are interested in my profile or have any questions about my code, you can contact me by email:
